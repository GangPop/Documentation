Intended usage \ud83d\udd17 By using this plugin, you are able to give players the ability to chat in-game with players on your Discord server, as well as having people on the Discord server be able to chat with people in the minecraft server - This can be useful for players that still want to communicate with players in-game, but can't access the Minecraft server for whatever reason. This plugin has a remote console feature. You can designate a text channel for the plugin to forward console messages, which also runs all messages sent into that channel as commands by the server console (You should restrict sending this channel to a developer or high ranking role only). Due to how Discord's permissions work, you can have some server roles have access to see the console, while also not allowing them to send messages in that channel, thus creating a read-only console for trusted staff members. Both chat and console are toggleable through the configuration file. Some options can be refreshed with /discordsrv reload by an OP or a player with the discordsrv.reload permission.

Is DiscordSRV compatible with BungeeCord? \ud83d\udd17 No, but you can install the plugin on every Bukkit server. (Do not use the same token for more than 1 server!) If you would like to have linked accounts shared across servers, you can connect your DiscordSRV instances to a MySQL database ( Experiment_Jdbc options) Why won't messages send from Minecraft to Discord? I have TownyChat installed btw. \ud83d\udd17 Towny's main channel's name is usually general , instead of DiscordSRV's default, global . I reloaded the plugin/server and now it won't work. \ud83d\udd17 Only reload the plugin using the plugin's specified reload command. ( /discordsrv reload ) If that doesn't work, restart your server. Some changes need this for them to take effect. Note Plugins made specifically for reloading/stopping/starting plugins (and the built-in server /reload command) can make those plugins stop working properly. When I join/quit my server, a message isn't sent in the chat channel for me. What gives? \ud83d\udd17 You have one of DiscordSRV's permissions to join/quit silently. To disallow this, give yourself or a group one of the following permissions depending on what you want to deactivate. groups : Owner : permissions : - -discordsrv.silentjoin - -discordsrv.silentquit - '*' #<-- \"positive\" permissions like this one should be AFTER the negated permissions How do I fix the error \"Unsupported major.minor version 52.0?\" \ud83d\udd17 Update the server's Java JRE version to Java 8 or contact your server provider and request an upgrade. The plugin crashes at serverstart reporting \"java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: com/scarsz/discordsrv/jda/managers/AccountManager\" \ud83d\udd17 One of the libraries that DiscordSRV uses ( Reflections ) requires ASM Version 5 to work. You're supposedly running a server with an old ASM version (i.e. 4.x) such as kCauldron / Thermos. Sadly this is a server software dependent problem and we are unable to fix it within DiscordSRV without violating plugin guidelines. Fix for Thermos, Cauldron and early KCauldron \ud83d\udd17 The SpecialSource library included with Thermos uses ASM4. Updating it to the latest version will fix the issue. Instructions for updating to ASM5: Navigate to the libraries\\net\\md-5\\SpecialSource\\1.7-SNAPSHOT folder of the server Delete the SpecialSource-1.7-SNAPSHOT.jar file Download SpecialSource v1.7.4 from https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/net/md-5/SpecialSource/1.7.4/SpecialSource-1.7.4.jar Copy the jar file to the libraries\\net\\md-5\\SpecialSource\\1.7-SNAPSHOT folder Rename the jar file you just copied to SpecialSource-1.7-SNAPSHOT.jar Fix for KCauldron \ud83d\udd17 The SpecialSource library included with KCauldron uses ASM4. Updating it to the latest version will fix the issue. Instructions for updating to ASM5: Navigate to the bin\\net\\md-5\\SpecialSource\\1.7-SNAPSHOT folder of the server Delete the SpecialSource-1.7-SNAPSHOT.jar file Download SpecialSource v1.7.4 from https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/net/md-5/SpecialSource/1.7.4/SpecialSource-1.7.4.jar Copy the jar file to the bin\\net\\md-5\\SpecialSource\\1.7-SNAPSHOT folder Rename the jar file you just copied to SpecialSource-1.7-SNAPSHOT.jar Only show errors in console-channel \ud83d\udd17 If you want to use your console-channel to only inform you about problems, you can achieve that by modifying the DiscordConsoleChannelLevels option: - DiscordConsoleChannelLevels: [info, warn, error] + DiscordConsoleChannelLevels: [error] Block special console-output from appearing in console-channel \ud83d\udd17 DiscordSRV allows you to hide phrases from appearing in console-channel. This can be achieved by making use of regular expressions . Some basic \"placeholders\" you have to know: RegEx escaping must be done with \\\\ instead of \\ in config files Here are some examples to visualize how it works: Example 1: Block output of /save-all \ud83d\udd17 DiscordConsoleChannelFilters : { \"^Saving\\\\.\\\\.\\\\.$|^Saved the game$\" : \"\" } Before >> save-all [ Mon , 20 . Apr 2020 04 : 20 : 69 CDT INFO ] Saving the game ( this may take a moment !) [ Mon , 20 .

Apr 2020 04 : 20 : 69 CDT INFO ] Scarsz logged in with entity id 564875 at ([ world ] 0 . 0 , 0 . 0 , 0 . 0 ) Can we op players from the discord console? \ud83d\udd17 DiscordSRV by default blacklists the use of a handful of commands through the console channel through the DiscordConsoleChannelBlacklistedCommands option. Remove the \"op\" value to allow the command to be used. - DiscordConsoleChannelBlacklistedCommands: [\"?\", \"op\", \"deop\", \"execute\"] + DiscordConsoleChannelBlacklistedCommands: [\"?\", \"deop\", \"execute\"] Why can't I control my music bot from Minecraft? \ud83d\udd17 It's bad practice for a bot to listen to another bot's messages. That's why most if not all public music bots can't be controlled through another bot. Where is the bot hosted? \ud83d\udd17 On the server that DiscordSRV is used on. The bot is online when the server is online. Can I modify the bot using javascript? \ud83d\udd17 No. It's programmed in Java, not Javascript. How can I show the player count in the game status? \ud83d\udd17 This can be done by using PlaceholderAPI 's %playerlist_<type>,<subtype>,<include>,<output>,<subtype_value>% placeholder in our DiscordGameStatus option. Make sure you have PlaceholderAPI installed Once the PlaceholderAPI plugin is loaded, run /papi ecloud download PlayerList to install the PlayerList expansion Run /papi reload to reload the PlaceholderAPI expansions Read through the PlayerList documentation on how to use the placeholder You can test the output of the placeholder using the /papi parse me <placeholder> command Why is the plugin red in the /plugins output? \ud83d\udd17 if the plugin is green if the plugin is red the plugin is working the plugin is not working First thing you should do is check your server logs . If you need further help understanding the errors then join our discord server and create a ticket through the #support channel. Send a copy of what you find or the whole log file. Where can I find the server log? \ud83d\udd17 Minecraft servers store their logs in <server_directory>/logs/ . Search for a file explorer in your server's management interface and navigate to that directory. If you find a logs folder search for the latest.log file. Some providers have a separate page for logs and may hide the logs folder. On Aternos: Go to https://aternos.org/log/ On Minehut and server.pro: Go to the \" files \" tab in the left menu Navigate to the root directory of your server From there navigate to /logs/latest.log What should I do with the server log? \ud83d\udd17 First of all, read it! I mean, that's what you do all the time when you run a server, isn't it? Try to locate any errors that have anything to do with DiscordSRV. If you're having trouble scrolling through the file you can use Ctrl+F to search the file for the phrase \"DiscordSRV\". This will highlight all occurrences of \"DiscordSRV\" which will make locating the error less difficult. If you got the latest.log file or created a .txt file with the necessary errors then join our discord server and create a ticket through the #support channel and send it there. If you have trouble downloading the log file, copy/paste the text to a paste service (like mclo.gs ). Copy the link that it gives you. Join our discord server and create a ticket through the #support channel, then send that link in your ticket. Why do I get all the groups instead of just the one I want? \ud83d\udd17 Check to make sure you don't have the * permission in any of the groups that you're a part of. DiscordSRV has a discordsrv.sync.<group> permission , and having the star perm ends up giving you the perm for every group you have synchronized. This is just one of many reasons why you shouldn't ever have the * perm, or OP for that matter. The bot can't modify my roles, and I'm the Discord server owner? \ud83d\udd17 This is a Discord limitation. Although bots can remove / add one role, they cannot use the endpoint that allows adding & removing as many roles as you want, which is how group-synchronisation achieves this. If you are trying to test group-synchronisation, either use an alt, or test it on another player.","title":"Frequently Asked Questions"},{"location":"FAQ/#minecraft-chat-to-discord-chat-doesnt-work","text":"DiscordSRV Minecraft -> Discord chat flowchart","title":"Minecraft chat to Discord chat doesn't work"},{"location":"FAQ/#Minecraft-to-Discord-Role-synchronization","text":"DiscordSRV Minecraft group <-> Discord Role synchronization flowchart","title":"I need help with Minecraft group &lt;-&gt; Discord Role synchronization"},{"location":"FAQ/#disable-a-featuremessage","text":"In most cases by clearing a value in the config. option: \"\" For example: - DiscordChatChannelServerStartupMessage: \":white_check_mark: **Server has started**\" + DiscordChatChannelServerStartupMessage: \"\" For format options with embeds, you just set Enabled to false : MinecraftPlayerLeaveMessage: - Enabled: true + Enabled: false Webhook: Enable: false AvatarUrl: \"%botavatarurl%\" Name: \"%botname%\" Content: \"\" Embed: Enabled: true Color: \"#ff0000\" Author: ImageUrl: \"%embedavatarurl%\" Name: \"%username% left the server\" Url: \"\" . . .","title":"How can I disable a feature/message?"},{"location":"FAQ/#embed-back-to-plain-text","text":"By moving the value in Embed.Author.Name to Content and setting Embed.Enabled to false MinecraftPlayerLeaveMessage: Enabled: true Webhook: Enable: false AvatarUrl: \"%botavatarurl%\" Name: \"%botname%\" - Content: \"\" + Content: \"%username% left the server\" Embed: - Enabled: true + Enabled: false Color: \"#ff0000\" Author: ImageUrl: \"%embedavatarurl%\" - Name: \"%username% left the server\" + Name: \"\" Url: \"\" ...","title":"How can I change a notification message embed back to plain text?"},{"location":"FAQ/#compatible-bungeecord","text":"No, but you can install the plugin on every Bukkit server.

You'll be surprised with how many features this plugin has Informations Avanc\u00e9es \ud83d\udd17 Giving the bot the administrator permission \ud83d\udd17 Usually it's not recommended to give the bot the Administrator permission, since it gives the bot complete control over your server. We recommend it because it makes the installation process easier on the server owner, and DiscordSRV doesn't do anything that would jeopardize the server. The only way this can be abused is by keeping the bot token secure. If you don't feel comfortable with this, you can define the following permissions that the bot requires for certain features. This list can/will change and new permissions will need to be added for any new features that require them.
